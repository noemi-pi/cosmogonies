# cosmogonies
A minimal and playful drawing application to create animated, space-themed shapes. Made with Processing.

## about
This program is constructed as a minimal and playful drawing application, which allows the user to create organic looking shapes, reminiscent of a universe in formation.
Users can invent their own universe using waves, bubbles, moon and suns animated shapes.
Clickable buttons activate the different drawing and editing modes. Use the mouse (by clicking and dragging) to create, rescale, move and delete shapes.

Realised as a project for Prof. Yenting Cho's Computational Media course (Fall 2018), National Cheng Kung University.
